# OptimalWiFi-HotspotPositioning_QUBO-Ising

 Using BQM (Binary Quadratic Model) to to optimize the placement of WiFi hotspot
 
  In this example we will learn how to analize architectural plans, particularly focusing on identifying zones, walls, and other features. Then applying graph theory to convert the image into a graph structure. Using BQM (Binary Quadratic Model) as showcase for using Classical DIMOD BQM Solver (SimulatedAnnealingSampler) compared to Dynex QUBO/Ising Solver.

 NOTE: this example is just for educational purposes and it cannot be used as standalone application due to insufficient parameters/constrains that need to be added.
